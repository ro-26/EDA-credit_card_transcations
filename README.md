## State Employee Credit Card Transactions - Data Analytics🚀
Data of State Government Employees Credit Card Transcations of the mid-Atlantic U.S. State is collected and Exploratoy Data Analysis is performed.Used
python libraries and tools to manipulate and visualize the data to gather insights and similarites among diffirent State Departments.Also,a Power BI 
Dashboard is made to summarize the few of the insights gathered.

### Features💡:
- Utilizes a time-series data of credit card transactions along with information on Department, Division and Merchant and Description.

- Time-series Anomaly Detection is performed using two techniques namely Isolation Forest and KMeans Clustering Algorithms.
- Further trained a KMeans model find similarities among different Departments in their temporal spending behavior and group them.
- And verified the same with the plot of dimensionally reduced data using IsoMap Dimensionality Reduction.
- Finally, a dashboard to showcase few of the insights gathered is made using Microsoft Power BI
